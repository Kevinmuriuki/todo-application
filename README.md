# Todo Application
This app records your todo tasks and shows the completed tasks and the ones that have not been completed yet...

## Why create this app
I am creating this app to learn new skills from the alx Full-stack nanodegree course at Udacity, and I inted to learn the following:

- Traversing across all layers of our backend stack, from our backend server in Flask to our database in Postgres, by understanding mappings between user operations, to the ORM, to the SQL executed on a database.
- Developing using the MVC Model-View-Controller pattern, for architecting out our application
- Handling changes to our data schema over time
- Modeling relationships between objects in our web application
- Implementing Search
